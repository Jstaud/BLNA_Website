## Overview

This repository contains the code for the Benbrook Lakeshore Neighborhood Association (BLNA) website[^1^][1]. The BLNA is a non-profit organization with a sole purpose to preserve and improve the surrounding neighborhoods[^1^][1].

## Features

The website offers several services to our community[^1^][1]:

- **Community Center**: We maintain the Benbrook Lakeshore community center for use by our neighbors for events, parties, classes, meetings, etc[^1^][1].
- **Parties and Events**: Our incredible event committee helps put on special events for all our neighbors and their families[^1^][1].
- **Neighborhood Security**: At the entrance to our neighborhood, we have deployed a "Flock" camera system that scans all license plates coming and going from the neighborhood[^1^][1].
- **Fiber Internet Access**: We are attempting to bring Fiber internet to every home in our neighborhood[^1^][1]!
