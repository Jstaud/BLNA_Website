description: If a hail storm damages your roof
---

# Storm Season
Spring storms will be here before we know it and they can bring large hail to damage roofs and other property. I have been in the roofing business since 1978 and owned my own business, Metroplex Roofing since 1991. 

I would like to offer these suggestions if a hail storm damages your roof.

Call your insurance as soon as you know or think there is damage to your roof, It will take an adjuster several days to come and inspect the roof. Once the evaluation has been made and if the roof needs replacement, he will give you an itemized estimate to do the repairs. There will most likely be a partial payment included. This check will be made out to you and your mortgage company if you have one. 
Most likely, you will have several roofing company sales persons knocking on your door. Be very careful!  These guys are pros and may tell you anything to get you to sign a contract. DO NOT SIGN A BLANK CONTRACT! 

My suggestion is to call an association such as North Texas Roofing Contractors Association or the Roofing Contractors Association of Texas. Do business with a local contractor who has been in business at least two years.The BBB is good but you can join and have a A+ rating. Be sure you find out how long they have been a member and how many complaints, even if all are satisfied. There was a new law passed a couple of years ago that the roofing companies can not waive your deductible or a portion thereof. Be very careful when negotiating a price.

Local references are good but a company is not going to give a reference that is bad.
I hope this information is helpful
