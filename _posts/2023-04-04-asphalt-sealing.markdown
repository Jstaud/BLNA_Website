### Understanding Asphalt Pavement

Asphalt pavement is a static material, meaning that once it is laid down, its properties remain unchanged unless replaced entirely. Over time, cracking is inevitable, and there is no foolproof way to prevent it. Other common issues include bleeding/polishing and loosened aggregate. Rutting or shifting should not occur and, if present, may indicate problems with the pavement's base structure or drainage.

### Seal Coating: Purpose and Limitations

Seal coating (also known as fog sealing) is a technique used by State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to revitalize pavement on public roads as well as private companies to revitalize residential and commercial pavement. This process typically involves the application of a new layer of aggregate material, creating a new wearing surface. Seal coating can be effective in addressing issues with surface aggregate becoming unbonded without affecting the overall pavement structure. However, this is not a standard or anticipated situation.

As a homeowner with a driveway, you are unlikely to experience the typical traffic load or heavy trucks traversing your driveway at high speeds, reducing the likelihood of your asphalt becoming worn out or damaged through use. Your primary concerns should be addressing potential issues stemming from poor design, substandard construction, or inadequate drainage. In the absence of these problems, there may be no need for intervention throughout the lifespan of your pavement, although its appearance may degrade over time. Seal coating can temporarily mitigate drainage issues originating from the pavement itself, rather than the surrounding yard, while also rejuvenating the surface appearance of your driveway.

### Key Takeaways

Before engaging into business with any asphalt contractor, make sure they are reputable and well reviewed. This can be done with a quick online search or a post on social media. Don't feel pressured to act fast when approached by door-to-door salesmen. A large financial decision like this should not be rushed into, and any good contractor will be willing to work with you if you need some time to plan for it. 

Driveway sealing costs $470 on average, with a typical range between $250 and $770. The price depends on factors like the size of your driveway, and the type of sealant and coating you choose. At the lower end, you could pay as little as $110. At the top end, you may pay up to $1,500. Generally seal coating can range in price from $0.08 to $0.50 per square foot for a single coat. Residential driveways typically only need one coat of sealant.

Weigh all of the pros and cons for your own situation and make an educated decision about seal coating your asphalt driveway. 

### Q&A

**Q: Is seal coating an effective way to prevent cracks?**

A: Seal coating does not prevent transverse or fatigue cracking. However, it can prevent edge cracking and spalling if caused by cold temperatures and oxidation. 

**Q: Does seal coating fill small cracks and slow down freeze-thaw issues?**

A: Seal coating can address these issues if applied correctly and in sufficient volumes to flow in and seal the cracks. If not done properly, it can exacerbate the problem.

**Q: Does seal coating extend the life of a driveway?**

A: When done correctly, seal coating can extend the life of a driveway for as long as the seal remains intact, which is typically about a year. For commercial parking lots, resealing the pavement may be worth the aesthetic improvement if it makes people feel better about patronizing your establishment.
