### Overview of The Current Proposition

Hello Tiger Trail Community!

I (Rob) have been working with the BLNA board and we have good news to report that our efforts to engage with Spectrum have paid off. We now have a proposal from them for a plan to provide fiber-based Internet service to all of the Tiger Trail community. This service will consist of guaranteed 500mbps both up and down (symmetric) service with no data caps to each residence. It will include a modem and router for each residence being serviced. And it includes Spectrum TV App streaming with 65+ channels, on-demand access to over 10,000 videos, ability to stream to phones and tablets, plus enablement on various streaming devices such as Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick, etc. Note that additional services like HBO/Showtime, Sports packages, Spectrum Mobile, etc. will be extra but discounted in association with this plan.

Spectrum is going to cover the installation cost up to the residence, including installing a fiber termination point within the residence. They will also provide a 365 24/7 support line for technical support and problem resolution. They will also offer additional custom installation services within the residence if desired at an additional cost.
The method of them providing this service will be to run a fiber-based infrastructure throughout the community. They will do this using the horizontal boring techniques you have seen being done in other areas such as the fiber install down Patricia’s Ridge not long ago. It is minimally disruptive to current property, unlike trenching. There might be an occasion in some places where they will use existing overhead poles but it sounded like that would be an exception and only if necessary.

The installation will take around 6-8 months from project start. Potentially, they will have it all in place by Q1 of 2024 if we are able to commit within the next few months.
To justify Spectrum’s capital investment (~$1.5M) to build out the infrastructure within our community, they are requesting that the BLNA HOA be the centralized point of engagement and the mechanism of commitment. Effectively, the cost of this fantastic plan will be based on and dependent on participation of the community. BLNA is now requesting your acknowledgement of interest.

### Key Takeaways

Note this is still effectively a petition for the BLNA in order to establish justification for a commitment with Spectrum. It is not a signup of services yet. That will be forthcoming from the BLNA as things get finalized and a subscription request is warranted.

We are looking for at least 70% of residences (~175) to indicate that “Yes, I’m in!” on this form. And if we achieve that, the service cost for the above plan would be ~$75/mo per residence. If we achieve higher participation, that cost could be reduced. If we do not achieve at least that level of participation, it becomes much more unlikely for the BLNA to be able to commit for this massive infrastructure investment with Spectrum.

So, I ask that you look at your current costs for Internet and TV and see if you don’t agree that this proposal is indeed fantastic compared to what we are getting right now from AT&T. For instance, currently the dismal internet service of 14 mbps down and 1 mbps up is being billed at $70/mo on Jamies Ridge. I certainly am willing to pay $5 more per month for a 35X improvement down and a 500X improvement up.

If you agree, please go to the form and check “Yes, I’m in!”.

### Questions

I am sure many of you have questions. Please send them to me at [wifi@benbrooklakeshore.org](mailto:rlake@benbrooklakeshore.org). I will post the collective questions and answers on the Facebook group page. This way the Facebook page will not get overly cluttered by many repeat questions and comments. Otherwise, it will be hard to follow.

There will be another community meeting planned to discuss this opportunity within a few weeks. But please do not wait to send your questions and indicate your interest in participation.
If you like, please also sign up to the BLNA website at [BenbrookLakeshore.org](https://benbrooklakeshore.org) so that you are tied into all the activities going on and the discussions of things being planned. We will be posting the FAQs there as well. 

You may also wish to contact the BLNA board as a whole. You can do that on the BLNA website using the Contact button on the top right.
Look forward to hearing back from you. Please engage timely so that we can take advantage of this opportunity as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Rob Lake
