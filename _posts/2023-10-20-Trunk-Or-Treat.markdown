SAVE THE DATE! Our awesome neighborhood **Tiger Trail Trunk-or-Treat 2023** will be held on Sunday, October 29 from 5:00 PM to 7:30 PM at the Community Center.

Come dressed in your favorite costume for a spooktacular evening of fun, games, and trunk-or-treating. **EVERYONE** is invited to join the Halloween festivities, so don't forget to bring your favorite drink to sip while you meet your neighbors.

We will award prizes for the **best costumes** for both adults and kids, so get creative and show off your Halloween spirit!

### We Need Your Help with the Trunk Games!

Are you ready to take your Halloween game to the next level? We're looking for volunteers to participate in our trunk games. It's simple - bring your car, pop the trunk, and set up a fun, themed game for kids and brave adults to win candy. Let your imagination run wild and create a game that will be a hit at the event.

Last year, someone did a **Pirate theme** and had a "walk the plank" game to win candy. The kids absolutely loved it! So, get creative and let's make this year's trunk games the best yet.
