Hello everyone. We are thrilled to announce that the Spectrum Infrastructure installation has finally begun. You may notice trucks, backhoes, and horizontal drilling rigs in various places around the neighborhood. They are digging access holes to drill horizontally and pull fiber conduit lines. You may also see surveyors measuring and marking the area. 

Please note that they will be working in the easements, so even if you didn't express interest, they might be working across your lot easement. We appreciate your patience during this time. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

If you encounter any issues or concerns with the Spectrum installation, please contact us via email at [wifi@benbrooklakeshore.org](mailto:wifi@benbrooklakeshore.org). We will relay your concerns to the construction team foreman, who is committed to resolving any issues and ensuring everything is done correctly.

Here are some updates on the progress:
- There is a new Fiber line coming from 377 up Tiger Trail. 
- There are now several Spectrum Fiber Junction boxes where they are joining the conduits they ran with the horizontal drill. You'll see these green top boxes buried around the neighborhood. 
- You'll see many new green Spectrum Fiber Distribution Poles placed around our neighborhood. These are about 2-3ft tall and will be the point of distribution for the fiber to be run to your homes!

As of today Spectrum is still working on finishing the install of the main lines on the back side of the neighborhood and once that is complete we should expect to start seeing them contact residents directly to schedule and plan out the fiber run to your homes.

Stay tuned for more updates on the fiber rollout!
